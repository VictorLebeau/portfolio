After several researches, Sarah Garcin and I confirmed our desire to create a tool for collaborative writing and knowledge sharing.
We focused on one of the key writing practices&#8239;:&#8239;note taking.
While note taking, everyone transcripts, in a shorten way, the orator spoken language.
We could pull our efforts together. But how could we mutualize, in real-time, note taking ?
Our tool's main goal is to allow a personal note taking and, in the same time, a visualisation of the other contributors's notes. This mutualisation produces an online document upgraded by everyone's work.
It is through experimentations and a pragmatic approach that we designed and prototyped our collaborative tool&#8239;:&#8239;Ping.
