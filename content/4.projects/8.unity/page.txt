Why couldn't we use a bus shelter as a web-wall&#8239;?
While waiting for our bus, we could share images, texts and posts on it. It's about the users to feed the wall by sending their propositions.

<br> 
You just need to get to the bus shelter, connect your device and send your publication. By default, the tool scrolls all the posts as a panorama. But the public can interact with this tactile wall by surfing in the publications.
